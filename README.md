ubuntu-chef-workout
===================

This repo at the moment only contains code whose purpose is to explore chef's
(and vagrant/berkshelf/knife-solo) capabilities in provisioning ubuntu 14.04.

Notes
=====

There are many configuration parameters described on the [kitchen-vagrant][1]
github gem repo game (provider, synced_folders, network, customize mem/cpu).
